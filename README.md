**DESCRIPTION**

The website consists of a simplistic Welcome page(with Typed Animation), a convenient navigation bar which changes opacity and design depending upon scrolling to different sections of the website. The NavBar also contains basic contacts links. It is followed by the about page consisting of a one-line intro, educational information and technical as well as non-technical interests. The skills page consists of technical skills represented as circular blobs and the projects page lays down a minimalist layout of three placeholder projects. The website ends with a general-styled footer.

**ADDITIONAL FEATURES**

- Smooth scrolling animation for NavBar links.
- Non-static background images for certain sections like non-technical interests.
- Typing Animation on the welcome page.
- Complete flexbox layout using bootstrap.
- NavBar which changes design and opacity depending on the section of website being scrolled but retains full opacity on being hovered.
- A loading animation.

**UNIQUE**

- A neat and minimalist welcome page.
- A very easy to view and use Navigation Bar.
- Smooth effects (scrolling, slideshow and opacity change)
- Representation of skills using graphical objects rather than standard lists.
- A professional and adaptable flexbox design with clear seperarion of sections.

**PROBLEMS FACED**

1. Setting styles and colors for each element resulted in a confusing and bug-ridden design, I fixed it by revamping the stylesheet and using standard bootstrap and w3 recommended designs throughout the website.
2. Often absolute layout caused sections to be drifted in multiple lines, I fixed it my using only flexbox layouts making the website neater and adaptable
3. Scrolling among sections by using navlinks looked abrupt, I fixed it by making scrolling smooth with the use of cubic-bezier animations.
4. NavBar covered background images in specific sections causing the page to look odd(in the Skills section), i fixed it by changing the opacity of the NavBar in those sections.

**SCOPE OF IMPROVEMENT**

I wanted to add tooltips on every skill and expand the skills page to include my recent activities, however I was not able to do so because of the time-crunch faced as many vivas and assignments were given during the project period.

**WHAT YOU LEARNED?**

This was the first complete front-end project I ever made and this really helped me to develop practical knowledge of front-end scripting, designing and basic animation. I also learned to create the project using standards provided by the web making it more user-friendly and professional looking.
